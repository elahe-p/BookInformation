# BookInformation
This project is a simple system to manage and display book data. The goal was to show clean architecture and my coding style, focusing on readability and separation of concerns.

---

## What I did
- Implemented Clean Architecture with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, WebAPI, and a small UI to show results
- Created DTOs and mapping for books and authors
- Built simple API endpoints to add, update, and list books
- Business rules are not embedded in controllers or infrastructure code

## Project Overview
- **Domain**: Core business entities and rules
- **Application**: Services, and business logic
- **Infrastructure**: Data access
- **WebAPI**: HTTP API layer
- **UI**: User interface layer, just to show result
